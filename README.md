# Tuba-seq analysis
Quantitative in vivo analyses for pharmacogenomic mapping in lung adenocarcinoma

## Overview
The lack of knowledge about the relationship between tumor genotypes and therapeutic responses remains one of the most important gaps in enabling the effective use of cancer therapies. Here, we couple a multiplexed and quantitative platform with robust statistical methods to enable pharmacogenomic mapping of lung cancer treatment responses in vivo. 
We validate the identified resistance using a large patient response dataset. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the genetic determinants of treatment responses in the development of precision therapies and define a strategy to identify such determinants.
